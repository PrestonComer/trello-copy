### Trello Copy

This project is an attempt to try and make a simplified copy of the project management website Trello.

### Copying Process

- Create a background
- Make blank lists that can be added and deleted
- Each list must have a title
- Make the lists draggable to move left and right
- Allow cards to be made inside of each list
- Make cards able to be moved from each list by dragging and dropping
- Clicking a card opens modal with title, description, comment section
- Elipsis in top right with drop down actions: Move all cards in list, delete all cards in list, add a card, sort by A-Z, sort by Z-A
- Clicking on name of list allows it to be renamed
